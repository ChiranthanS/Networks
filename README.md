# Networks Project

This project contains implementations and simulations of key networking protocols, including DNS, HTTP, SMTP, and a custom networking application (Netster). Each directory contains the code, documentation, and tools necessary to explore and interact with these protocols.

## Project Structure

- **dns/**: This directory contains code related to the Domain Name System (DNS), which resolves human-readable domain names into IP addresses.
  
- **http/**: Contains an implementation of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the foundation of data communication for the web. This can include server and client components for sending and receiving HTTP requests and responses.
  
- **smtp/**: This directory implements the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), which is used to send emails across the internet. It demonstrates the process of email transmission and how SMTP clients and servers interact.

- **netster_py/**: A custom networking application designed to demonstrate basic socket programming in Python. This project shows how to create simple network services, which can act as a foundation for further experimentation with network communications.

## Key Features

- **DNS Resolution**: Simulates how DNS servers convert domain names to IP addresses, handling client queries and responses.
- **HTTP Communication**: Provides an understanding of how HTTP servers and clients interact by sending and receiving HTTP messages.
- **SMTP Email Handling**: Demonstrates the steps involved in sending emails over a network using SMTP.
- **Socket Programming**: Explores the basics of socket programming with Python in the `netster_py` directory, showing how to establish TCP/UDP connections between clients and servers.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Networking protocols: DNS, HTTP, SMTP
- Socket programming

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the respective directory for each protocol (e.g., `dns`, `http`, `smtp`, or `netster_py`) and follow the instructions provided in their individual README files or documentation.

3. Run the Python scripts as needed to simulate network protocol behavior or to build on top of existing functionality.
